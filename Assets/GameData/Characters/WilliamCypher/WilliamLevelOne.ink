Good evening, young man. Welcome to the world where every shadow has a story, and every silence sings a secret. I am William Cipher, and you, Henry Watson, are about to embark on an adventure unlike any other.

You may wonder why I mainly chose you as my apprentice. But the answer to that is a cipher in itself, one you will untangle in due time.

Our quest, dear boy, is against the clandestine Enigma Order, a society that communicates with ciphers, its very existence a conundrum. And you, my young apprentice, have an important role to play.

. . .

Before we dive into the deep, let's paddle in the shallows. You might have already seen a letter on the table, that letter is your first test.

It is encoded with a simple shift cipher. The solution is no grand secret, merely a hint for something bigger. But it will give me an idea of your aptitude.

. . .

Remember, Henry, every detail has a story to tell. In this enigmatic world, silence often speaks louder than words, and shadows harbor secret dances.

Keep your senses sharp, and don't forget: the truth often lurks in the simplest of things, hidden in plain sight. And sometimes, the answer might be as easy as <b>the third</b> stroke of a clock.
